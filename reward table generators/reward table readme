Directory for MATLAB scripts that generate reward tables for Q-learning

paddler2limb_reward.m - runs through all possible state/action pairs for 2-paddler swimmer and calls the 
paddler2limb.m fluid solver to calculate translational velocity. 
Integrates the velocity to get net displacement and fills reward table with these values.

paddler3limb_reward.m - runs through all possible state/action pairs for 3-paddler swimmer and calls the 
paddler3limb.m fluid solver to calculate translational velocity. 
Integrates the velocity to get net displacement and fills reward table with these values.

paddler4limb_reward.m - runs through all possible state/action pairs for 3-paddler swimmer and calls the 
paddler4limb.m fluid solver to calculate translational velocity. 
Integrates the velocity to get net displacement and fills reward table with these values.
